title: About me
---

I completed a MS in Physics at the University of Turin in Italy, where I studied Physics, parallel programming, statistics and Montecarlo techinques.
I am passionate and enthusiastic about computer science, software development and open source. My first opportunity to contribute in an open source project arrived in the summer 2015, 
I started to contribute to [php-telegram-bot](https://github.com/php-telegram-bot/core), an open source library to create chatbots for Telegram. At the same time [I created Grocery List Bot](https://botpublication.com/how-i-created-grocery-list-bot-the-bot-that-share-on-telegram-messenger-your-grocerylist-5b7461b17766) one of the [eight Telegram bots that simplify your life](http://www.lastampa.it/2016/04/19/tecnologia/news/ecco-otto-bot-di-telegram-che-ti-semplificano-la-vita-e-come-usarli-o1HmFzC1FcyIwx05e6lYVI/pagina.html), accoring to "La Stampa" an italian newspaper.
Thanks to those two projects I learned the best practice in software development and deployment.
I recently started the Ph.D in physics working on Data Acquisition system.
This website is mostly an exercise for improving my fluency in written english. Find an error, I will pay you a coffee!
